# SNESMouse
A C++ Program that converts a USB SNES controller into a mouse.

NOTE: GitHub says this is a C project because of the sheer number of header files that have been included from SDL.

# Building 

Just download all the files and cross your fingers. SDL is already inside the project and the Visual Studio solution has been configured to automatically detect it and link it and all that jazz.

# Using SNESMouse

You will need a USB SNES controller.

The D-pad moves the cursor around

The shoulder buttons are left and right click respectively

SELECT will decrease the movement speed of the mouse cursor

START will increase the movement speed of the mouse cursor
